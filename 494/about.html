				<div class="cr1 collapse">
					<p><b>(a) Design systems or processes</b></p>
					<p id="cr1a">
					I think that ISU has done a satisfactory job at teaching me how to design. Mostly, I was taught the standards for showing designs and why modularity is a good thing.
					</p>
					<p><b>(b) Formulate and solve engineering problems?</p></b>
					<p id="cr1b">
					ISU has taught me about how to solve engineering problems with experiences.
					</p>
					<p><b>(c) Impact engineering solutions in a global/societal context?</p></b>
					<p>
					ISU will be a reason for any impact I may cause. This is due to the requirements for electives. The engineering classes were basic but I felt like ISU has broadened my perspecitve on the world so that I may make an impact someday.

				<div class="cr2 collapse">
					<p><b>(a) Work in groups</b></p>
					<p id="cr2a">
					ISU taught me how to work in groups by having every class include a group project within it. The best way to learn group collaboration is to work with them.
					</p>
					<p><b>(b) Recognize contemporary issues</p></b>
					<p id="cr2b">
					The electives that I took at ISU made learning about contemporary issues interesting and palatable. 
					</p>
					<p><b>(c) Understand professional and ethical responsibilities</p></b>
					<p id="cr2c">
					ISU, through their required and elective courses, has taught me a philosophy that summarizes professional and ethical responsibilities that I am using moving forward. That philosophy being: if I were on the receiving end of my decision, how would I feel?

					<p>
					As a programmer, I'm able to look up references using Google that I have needed to access quickly and efficiently without breaking up my workflow. I do research as I'm doing work, and having professionals at my fingertips when needed helps me learn to my maximum capacity.

				</a>
				
				<div class="cr5 collapse">
					<p>
					I've started learning a lot about a myriad of different topics. From game and UX design to law to smartphones, I've taken what I've learned at ISU and applied it so that I could quickly learn the basics of new topics. I've been studying smartphone hardware for the last 2 years, and, through my engineering courses, has given me confidence to undertake projects I wouldn't otherwise attempt. As an example, I'm attempting to fix my smartphone screen which has been broken for awhile.

					Within the next year or two, I have two paths I can take. For the first path, I will go to graduate school for a Masters in Computer Science. The other path is working in the industry at some job at some company in the world. If I enter industry, I'd hope to have a job that I can work at with enthusiasm. If I went for my Masters, I would continue to go for my Ph.D. and be a professor at some university.

					GE2. What have you learned in general education electives that allow you to evaluate and formulate engineering solutions with problem solving and innovation beyond the technical aspects in problem solving? How do general education classes help you think about an engineering problem?
					</b>
				</a>
				<div class="ge2 collapse">
					<p>
					General education electives have given me a completely different perspective about the world around me. These electives help show me what people say they want, and what they actually mean. Since I'm aiming to be a UX Designer, many of my electives have gone into trying to view the world differently. These electives have helped me view what other people might think about software I create, and allows me to understand people on a more fundamental level than I have previously experienced. These electives have taught me that people have reasons behind what they do, and have broaden my perspectives on the world.

					<b>
					GE3. Describe specific instances where you used knowledge/skills from general elective courses for innovation in engineering problems. What impact does meshing technical engineering skills and general electives-based innovation have in an economic, global, or societal context?</b>
					</b>
				</a>
				<div class="ge3 collapse">
					<p>
					To answer this question, I'll cover a project called Rat Pack Studios. <a href="projects.html">You can review the project here.</a> Although I hadn't had many electives, I was able to take what I learned, and through it, I created an ingenious solution to a problem the group was having. I created a heartbeat system. This system was used on our website to help with the communication between clients. The system being used had a strict limitation of being a php server, which means the server didn't support client to client communication. Because the project required multi-user communication for games, the heartbeat system solved the communication problem. 
			
			General electives are good for any major, not just engineering. Having a broader persepctive of the world allows one to create solutions that may have been completely hidden. The impact might not be that great, but having a general knowledge of a variety of topics is a great way to be flexible in any work-environment.
