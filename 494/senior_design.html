		<h1>Smart Pet Feeder</h1>
		
		<p>The Smart Pet Feeder is a project whose goal is to create an Internet of Things (IoT) device that feeds food to pets. In this project, I am the web and app developer. This means I'll be creating all of the UIs for this project. 
		My apps will make calls to the server which will, then, tell the pet-feeder to dispense food. I will be responsible for displaying all information in a user-friendly manner and giving the user control over their feeder(s).
		</p>

		<p>
		This project is the first step into having pets, who live at home for extended times, fed without the need for a person being home. In addition, this project can be expanded to include any animal that needs fed.
