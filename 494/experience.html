						<dt>Duties and Project Definitions</dt>
						<dd>This is the technical position I've had as an undergradutate here at Iowa State University. While in this position, I helped gradutate students directly with their work which meant I had to learn the project architecture they were using. The specific projects I worked on included the following: Triangulation, Mastercam x6 to Mastercam x8 port, Mesh Smoothing, and Win32 UI programming.</dd>
					
						<dt>Skills Learned</dt>
						<dd>During this period, I learned a lot about 3D support on Windows platforms. This included using the Win32 API and using OpenGL. The Mastercam port taught me a lot about how enterprise architecture can be a convoluted mess of code with no documentation. The main project was highly entangled with Mastercam x6 code when I arrived, and after I finished, the code was more modular with the Mastercam version. Entangled code was a huge problem that I spent most of my time dealing with.
						I also learned valuable communication skills. This position showed me what happens when communication stops working between people. I have learned since then that communication about even the tiniest of things will help make lives easier in the future.</dd>
						
						<dt>Final Presentation</dt>
						<dd>This position had no final presentation. The closest thing to a final presentation was when I was integrating my code into the main code base before I left. All I did was describe what each folder contained, and the main developer knew exactly where to use my files.</dd>
						
						<dt>What I learned from the position</dt>
						<dd>Not only did I learn how valuable constant communication is, but I've learned that working in a production environment is not similar to how I was taught to code in classes.</dd>

						<dd>This job isn't an internship, but it was my first and longest held job. It taught me how to work, so I figured it should be mentioned here.</dd>
						<dt>Duties and Project Definitions</dt>
						<dd>While working here, I specialized in making sure that company policies were followed and understood by other Crew Members. In addition, I focused on providing the best possible experience for every customer. My main project, while working at McDonald's, was to be the manager's go-to man to help manage specific sections of the store. An example would be managing the kitchen, or managing the Drive-Thru. This hierarchy made communication quick and easy.</dd>
					
						<dt>Skills Learned</dt>
						<dd>I learned how to communicate with others. In addition, I started learning what I liked and didn't like about Human-Computer Interaction because even McDonald's uses computer interaction. I also learned basic Spanish while helping those that didn't speak English. All around, it was a really good first job.</dd>
